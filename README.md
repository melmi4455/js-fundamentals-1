## Variables and Values exercise
1. Declare variables called `country`, `continent` and `population` and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console
3. Declare a variable called `language` and set the value to the language spoken in your country

8. The avarage population of a country is 33 million using comparions operators is your countries population have less people than the average country
9. Based on the varaibles you created create a variable `description` which contains a string with this format *'YOURCOUNTRY is in YOURCONTINENET and its YOURPOPULATION million people speak YOURLANGUAGE'*

## If & Else statements 

10. if your countries population is greater than 33 million, log a string like this to the console *'YOURCOUNTRY's population is above average'* otherwise, log a string like *'YOURCOUNTRY's population is YOURPOPULATION, bellow average'*

## Logical Operators

11. Lets saying Ahmed is looking for a new country to leave in. He wantes to live in a country with a population less than 50 million and is not on the coast. Write a if statement to help Ahmed see if your country fits the conditions
12. If your country is the right country log a string like this: *'you should live in YOURCOUNTRY!'* if not log *'YOURCOUNTRY does not meet your criteria :('*  (NOTE: if your country doesnt meet the criteria change some variables to make sure the codition is working properly)
